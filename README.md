HELLO GUYS, I am Shreyas Deshpande.

I have done a To-Do List project using web languages like- HTML, CSS & JS. This project is a part of a internship which i am doing at Systemtron. I have used my knowledge of web development & applied it during completion of this project. And finally got output succesfully. I have attached screenshot of output in the repository.

Steps to use:- Download all files from this repository. Save it in a single folder. Open index.html to view output.

Hope you will use and like it !!!
